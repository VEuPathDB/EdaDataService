#
# If `app.package.root` is "com.foobar" and `app.package.service` is "demo" then
# the app is expected to be located at "com.foobar.demo"
app.package.service=demo

# Main class name
#
# This class must be located at "${app.package.root}.${app.package.service}".
#
# For example, given the root package "org.foobar", the service package "demo",
# and the main class "Main" the build will look for the main class at
# "org.foobar.demo.Main".
