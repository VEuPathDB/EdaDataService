// TODO: Explain the raml-2-jaxrs / raml-2-json-schema / etc.. and any hacks or weirdness that people may need to know when modifying this project.

== Running the Example

=== Locally

==== Prerequisites

* Maven
* NodeJS/NPM

==== Setup & Run

Environment/dependency setup for local development can be done via the command
`make install-dev-env`.  This will install the dependencies required to build the
project.

After the environment has been set up, the project can be built, tested, and
packaged using `make jar`.

Starting the server can be done by simply running
`java -jar build/lib/service.jar`.

=== In Docker

==== Prerequisites

* Docker

==== Setup & Run

The project container can be built using `make docker`.  The first build
of the container will take several minutes.

Running the built container can be done with `docker run --rm demo-service`.


//------------------------------------------------------------------------------


== Development

To use this project as a template for the development of a new service, use the
"Use this template" button above to create a new project based off of this repo.

=== Quick Start

. Clone your new project and cd into the cloned directory
. Run `make install-dev-env cleanup-example`
. Edit `service.properties` with your service's details.
. Run `make fix-path` to move the service code to the correct location
. Edit `api.raml` with your API design
. Create any necessary types in `docs/schema`
. Run `make gen-jaxrs` to generate skeleton code
. Implement the generated service interfaces.
. Register your services in the `Resources` class.
. Run `make test` to run any unit tests and verify that things compile.

=== Detailed Overview

==== Environment Prerequisites

NPM:: Required to run https://github.com/raml2html/raml2html[raml2html]
Maven:: Required to build
https://github.com/mulesoft-labs/raml-for-jax-rs[raml-to-jaxrs] &
https://github.com/VEuPathDB/FgpUtil[FgpUtil]

==== Configuration

Configuration for the build is primarily done through the `service.properties`
file.  Here you can configure the project's name, version, container name,
Java package structure, etc...

If additional dependencies are required, they will be added to the
`dependencies.gradle.kts` file.  For information about adding gradle
dependency declarations see the
https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_dependencies.html[Gradle docs].

==== API definition

The service api is defined in 2 places initially:

. The `api.raml` file which contains the server endpoints.
. The `schema` folder which contains type schema definitions. +
  These files must be valid Raml 1.0 Libraries.footnote:[https://medium.com/raml-api/raml-101-libraries-and-datatypes-fragments-1889b2e82c27[Modular Raml Guide 1]]footnote:[https://www.baeldung.com/modular-raml-includes-overlays-libraries-extensions[Modular Raml Guide 2]]

===== `api.raml`

====== Including Type Definitions

In the `api.raml` file, there is a statement near the top of the file that
declares the Raml file "uses" `schema/library.raml`.  This is a generated
file based on the contents of the schema library under `schema`.  The
`library.raml` file should not be edited directly.

.`api.raml`: `uses` declaration
[source, yaml, linenums, start=5]
----
uses:
  err: .tools/raml/errors.raml
  lib: schema/library.raml
----

The `uses` keyword maps an import alias to the imported library.  This import
alias is used to access the types defined in that library.  In the case of the
above example, library types would be available using `lib.\{MyTypeName}`

.`api.raml`: Library type usage.
[source, yaml, linenums, start=36]
----
        body:
          application/json:
            type: lib.HelloResponse
----

===== Type Schema

Each raml library file under `schema` should define a root `types` object
defining the types used by the API.  The name of the types defined under the
`types` object will be the name of the generated Java classes based on those
types.

  @JsonProperty("foo")
  private String foo;

  @JsonProperty("foo")
  public String getFoo() {
    return this.foo;
  }

  @JsonProperty("foo")
  public void setFoo(String foo) {
    this.foo = foo;
  }
}

==== Generating A Service

Once your API spec is complete, you can begin development of Java code by
running `make gen-jaxrs`.  This will create a skeleton of the API in the
`generated` source package located under the root package defined using the
`app.package` values in `service.properties`.

The generated interfaces and types have the basic necessary annotations for use
by both Jackson and Jersey.

Once you have implemented the interfaces defined under
`\{source-package}.generated.resources` they must be registered in the
`\{source-package}.Resources` class.

==== Run Your Service

Running your service locally can be done by following the same steps as defined
above in the <<Running the Example>> section:

. Run `make build-jar`
. Run `java -jar build/lib/service.jar`

Running in Docker can be done by:

. Run `make build-docker`
. Run `docker run <your-image-name>`

== Other Information

=== Authentication

The base service contains an authentication layer that will be enabled on any
service class or method annotated with `@Authenticated`.  This authentication
will validate a WDK user session against the account database and append user
profile information to the incoming request object.

=== Make Targets

`compile`::
. Generates code & docs if the API def has changed.
. Compiles Java code if anything has changed.

`test`::
. Generates code & docs if the API def has changed.
. Compiles Java code if necessary.
. Runs unit tests.

`jar`::
. Generates code & docs if the API def has changed.
. Compiles Java code if necessary.
. Runs unit tests if necessary.
. Packages a self-contained runnable jar.

`docker`::
. Runs `docker build` for the project.

`install-dev-env`::
. Checks for system prerequisites.
. Downloads and builds raml-to-jaxrs.
. Installs the Oracle JDBC components into the `vendor` directory.
. Downloads, builds, and installs the FgpUtil project into the `vendor`
  directory.
. Installs the required NPM packages

`gen-jaxrs`::
. Generates Java code from the Raml spec.

`gen-docs`::
. Generates API docs from the Raml spec.

`fix-path`::
. Migrates the source code from the demo package to the correct package as
  defined in `service.properties`

=== Build Process

Presently the build process is operated through a makefile which calls and sets
up the necessary prerequisites.  This is a temporary solution to be used until

- https://github.com/VEuPathDB/FgpUtil[FgpUtil] is converted to a Gradle
  friendly form (via Java9 modularization and package publishing)
- https://github.com/VEuPathDB/lib-jaxrs-container-build-utils[The build utils]
  are converted into a gradle library
- The team as a whole is familiar with Gradle and Docker

==== Generating Jax-RS Code

The `make gen-jaxrs` command is backed by the https://github.com/mulesoft-labs/raml-for-jax-rs[Mulesoft Raml-for-JaxRs library].

===== Hiccups and limitations

The RAML to JaxRS conversion library has the following known issues that are
likely to impact use of the tool:

Enums::
+
--
* Enum generation creates types that do not allow access to the raw backing
  text, which may be desired when constructing complex responses.
* Enum generation may cause the generator to fail with cryptic errors involving
  bad imports for the Java builtin type `String`
--
+
One alternative/workaround for this is defining the enum type in Java and typing
the RAML as string with the possible values defined as examples.

Inheritance::

Extending types can work out for trees with at most 1 parent depth, however
going beyond that may cause things to generate in a way that has compile errors.

`additionalProperties` aka `//:`::

Using a catchall block for maps with anything other than a simple value type
will cause the java type to be `Map<String, Object>`.  Additionally even a
simple value type _may_ have this result.

==== Hacks and Oddities

===== FgpUtil

Due to the fact that FgpUtil is not a Gradle project, in a Maven repo, or safe
to use with standard imports (due to likelyhood of dependency conflicts), at
present, this dependency is built separately from the rest of the project by one
of the make targets and is included as a local, runtime dependency.

Due to this method of including FgpUtil, additional dependencies have been added
to support it in addition to bridging compatibility issues.

=== The project root

The root directory of this project contains multiple standard files used by
Gradle, Docker, Make, and GitHub, in addition to custom files created for
developer convenience.
